I’m an industrial engineer with a strong focus on integrating technology and linguistics. Currently, I’m a Language and Technology Specialist at the [Academy of Persian Language and Literature](https://apll.ir/), where I explore the intersection of Linguistics and Natural Language Processing to advance the Persian language.

My background includes serving as a Terminology Expert at the [Research Center of Terminology Studies](https://apll.ir/rcts/) and a part-time Editor at [Goman Publication](https://gomanbook.com/), where I’ve refined my skills in content quality and editorial processes. Previously, I was the Chief Operating Officer at [Lahn-e Digar](https://www.instagram.com/lahnedigar/), overseeing operations and implementing technology-driven solutions to enhance efficiency.
